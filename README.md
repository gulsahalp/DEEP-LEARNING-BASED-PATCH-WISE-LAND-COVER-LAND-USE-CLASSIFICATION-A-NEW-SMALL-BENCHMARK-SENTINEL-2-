# DEEP-LEARNING-BASED-PATCH-WISE-LAND-COVER-LAND-USE-CLASSIFICATION-A-NEW-SMALL-BENCHMARK-SENTINEL-2-IMAGE-DATASET

In this research, patch-wise land cover and land use (LCLU) classification was performed using the state-of-art ResNet 50 and Inception-ResNet-V2 architecture trained with Stochastic Gradient Descent(SGD) and Nadam optimizers. A new dataset was generated for the classification task using Sentinel-2 images having different patch sizes. The image patches were labeled using CORINE Land Cover (CLC) 2018 map. 
The dataset has 1961 image patches and it was divided into 1397 training and 564 testing patches during the experiment. Our dataset contains samples labeled with 7 CLC Level-2 classes. While the best training accuracy of 98.0% was obtained by Inception-ResNet-V2 trained with Nadam. The best testing accuracy of 93.0% was achieved with Inception-ResNet-V2 by using SGD optimizer.
